    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Seasonal Marketing**: Since there is a clear seasonal pattern in the count of rental bikes, Yulu can adjust its marketing strategies accordingly. Focus on promoting bike rentals during the spring and summer months when there is higher demand. Offer seasonal discounts or special packages to attract more customers during these periods.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Time-based Pricing**: Take advantage of the hourly fluctuation in bike rental counts throughout the day. Consider implementing time-based pricing where rental rates are lower during off-peak hours and higher during peak hours. This can encourage customers to rent bikes during less busy times, balancing out the demand and optimizing the resources.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Weather-based Promotions**: Recognize the impact of weather on bike rentals. Create weather-based promotions that target customers during clear and cloudy weather, as these conditions show the highest rental counts. Yulu can offer weather-specific discounts to attract more customers during these favorable weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **User Segmentation**: Given that around 81% of users are registered, and the remaining 19% are casual, Yulu can tailor its marketing and communication strategies accordingly. Provide loyalty programs, exclusive offers, or personalized recommendations for registered users to encourage repeat business. For casual users, focus on providing a seamless rental experience and promoting the benefits of bike rentals for occasional use.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Optimize Inventory**: Analyze the demand patterns during different months and adjust the inventory accordingly. During months with lower rental counts such as January, February, and March, Yulu can optimize its inventory levels to avoid excess bikes. On the other hand, during peak months, ensure having sufficient bikes available to meet the higher demand.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Improve Weather Data Collection**: Given the lack of records for extreme weather conditions, consider improving the data collection process for such scenarios. Having more data on extreme weather conditions can help to understand customer behavior and adjust the operations accordingly, such as offering specialized bike models for different weather conditions or implementing safety measures during extreme weather.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Customer Comfort**: Since humidity levels are generally high and temperature is often below 28 degrees Celsius, consider providing amenities like umbrellas, rain jackets, or water bottles to enhance the comfort and convenience of the customers. These small touches can contribute to a positive customer experience and encourage repeat business.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Collaborations with Weather Services**: Consider collaborating with weather services to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts to potential customers. Incorporate weather information into your marketing campaigns or rental app to showcase the ideal biking conditions and attract users who prefer certain weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Seasonal Bike Maintenance**: Allocate resources for seasonal bike maintenance. Before the peak seasons, conduct thorough maintenance checks on the bike fleet to ensure they are in top condition. Regularly inspect and service bikes throughout the year to prevent breakdowns and maximize customer satisfaction.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Customer Feedback and Reviews**: Encourage customers to provide feedback and reviews on their biking experience. Collecting feedback can help identify areas for improvement, understand customer preferences, and tailor the services to better meet customer expectations.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Social Media Marketing**: Leverage social media platforms to promote the electric bike rental services. Share captivating visuals of biking experiences in different weather conditions, highlight customer testimonials, and engage with potential customers through interactive posts and contests. Utilize targeted advertising campaigns to reach specific customer segments and drive more bookings.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Special Occasion Discounts**: Since Yulu focusses on providing a sustainable solution for vehicular pollution, it should give special discounts on the occassions like Zero Emissions Day (21st September), Earth day (22nd April), World Environment Day (5th June) etc in order to attract new users.\n"

    "### Insights and Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A total of 14,817 distinct trips were recorded between various source and destination points during September and October of 2018.\n",
    "- There were 1,504 delivery routes utilized for these trips.\n",
    "- The data comprises 1,508 unique source centers and 1,481 unique destination centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Among the 14,817 total distinct trips:\n",
    "   - 8,908 (60%) were categorized under Carting, employing small vehicles,\n",
    "   - 5,909 (40%) were categorized as FTL (Full Truck Load), facilitating quicker deliveries due to the absence of intermediate pickups or drop-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Test Outcomes:\n",
    "- The two-sample t-test provided insights such as:\n",
    "    - The average `time_taken_btwn_odstart_and_od_end` for the population equates to the average `start_scan_to_end_scan` for the population.\n",
    "    - The population's average `actual_time` is lesser than the average `start_scan_to_end_scan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis:\n",
    "- The analysis reveals that cities like Mumbai (Maharashtra), Delhi, Gurgaon (Haryana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Hyderabad (Telangana), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Pune (Maharashtra), Chandigarh, and Kolkata (West Bengal) record a high number of intra-city trips.\n",
    "- Regarding unequal source and destination states, the highest number of trips occur between: Delhi to Gurgaon, Gurgaon to Bengaluru, Bhiwandi/Mumbai to Pune (Maharashtra), and Sonipat to Gurgaon (Haryana).\n",
    "- Numerous deliveries to airports were noted, including routes like Chennai to MAA Chennai International Airport, Pune to Pune Airport (PNQ), Kolkata to CCU West Bengal Kolkata International Airport, and Bengaluru to BLR-Bengaluru International Airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the Bar charts and calculated tables, it's apparent that the majority of trips occur within specific cities. Moreover, regarding average distance between destinations, routes like Guwahati to Mumbai, Bengaluru to Chandigarh, Bengaluru to Delhi, and Bengaluru to Gurgaon are among the longest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significant Long-Distance Routes:\n",
    "- Routes with substantial distances and high trip occurrences include: Guwahati to Bhiwandi, Bengaluru to Chandigarh, Bengaluru to Delhi, Gurgaon to MAA Chennai Airport, Bhiwandi to Kolkata, Bengaluru to Kolkata, Gurgaon to Hyderabad, and Gurgaon to Kolkata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-City Routes:\n",
    "- Notable multi-city routes include: Guwahati to LakhimpurN, Jaipur to Tarnau, Guwahati to Tura, Mangalore to Udupi, Ajmer to Raipur, Mainpuri to Tilhar - each traversing through more than eight cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Busiest Routes and High-Activity States:\n",
    "- Delhi to Haryana emerges as the busiest route with over 400 trips. Other busy routes include Haryana to Uttar Pradesh, Chandigarh to Punjab, and Delhi to Uttar Pradesh.\n",
    "- States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Telangana, Gujarat, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh have recorded over 1,000 trips (Cells In.[173]).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Traffic Warehouses:\n",
    "- Warehouses experiencing significant traffic, and thus identified as busiest junctions, include: Bengaluru (Karnataka), Gurgaon (Haryana), Mumbai (Maharashtra), Hyderabad (Telangana), Delhi, Pune (Maharashtra), Chandigarh (Punjab), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Sonipat (Haryana), Kolkata (West Bengal), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), MAA (Tamil Nadu), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), Surat (Gujarat), Muzaffarpur (Bihar), FBD (Haryana), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), and Noida (Uttar Pradesh).\n"

For long-distance or heavy load deliveries, utilizing Heavy trucks is recommended. By adhering to this strategy, delivery times can be optimized which in turn, may enhance revenue generation according to the operational requirements.\n",
